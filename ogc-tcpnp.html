<div id="persistent-swgs"><h4>7.7.1.2. Persistent SWGs</h4>

  <p id="_fd9fb631-897f-41ce-a3e2-12017fcf35b0">By default, OGC SWGs are persistent until the SWG elects to become inactive or disband. Persistence supports the ability to maintain the standard products of the SWG, work on multiple revisions of an existing OGC standard, or to insure that long-term collaboration with other SWGs can be maintained. There may be reasons why a SWG is chartered not to be persistent and such reasons must be described in the charter. The Charter template has a section that specifies whether a SWG is persistent or not.</p>

SWG Charter Approval and Formation</h4><p id="_4ad61150-154a-4246-b688-7818ed972d58">The TCC will work with either the candidate standard submission team or an interested group of members that wish to craft a new OGC standard to write the draft SWG Charter. Once a draft is completed, the charter review and approval process as defined in <a href="#approval-of-a-sub-group-charter">Clause 7.5.3</a> shall be followed. For the purposes of charter development and approval, consider that the ad-hoc group and a submission team are equivalent in that a submission team is an ad-hoc group.</p>

Such commitment shall be made be made pursuant to a written declaration in the form of Appendix A to this IPR Policy.</p>
<p id="_02155e36-1ad2-41f1-aa29-dafab78fbcdf">If the member representative does elect to participate (opt-in), then there is a 30-day period during which the member representative can participate but cannot vote.

<div id="swg-voting-members"><h3>7.7.4. SWG voting members</h3><p id="_2d024b80-2a92-46ea-8641-999f07565ac4">All of the SWG charter members can vote at the first meeting of the new SWG and are therefore deemed "voting members" of the SWG.</p>
<p id="_62d49b41-af51-4d7f-9d5d-b0a6ac737ed9">After the 30-day waiting period, any member representative who is not a charter member may request that the SWG chair change their status to a voting member of the SWG. Once the Chair approves the request, the member can then vote on any item or issue brought before the SWG. Any member who has been participating in a SWG for 30 days but does not wish to be a voting member can remain of group member and participate.</p></div>

  <p id="_7665bc45-55e7-4786-b499-00a746d5a974">The first order of business of a new SWG is to elect a Chair and Co-chair. The Chair and Co-chair must be from different Member organizations. When there are adequate nominations or volunteers for the Chair/Co-chair, the SWG Convener will call for a vote of members who have opted in to participate in the SWG. In the case where there is only one nomination for Chair and one for co-chair, the SWG Convener will ask the SWG members whether there is any objection to unanimous consent. The election of a Chair or Co-Chair can happen at either a TC Meeting or via email. The election of the Chair and Co-Chair does not require TC or PC approval. Once the election is complete, the new Chair shall notify the TCC of the results of the Chair and Co-chair election.</p>

Failure of the Chair and/or Co-chair to provide these capabilities will result in the removal of the Chair and the election of a new Chair. If no suitable Chair can be located, then the work of the SWG will be considered to be non-critical and the SWG will be dissolved.</p></div>
<div id="swg-voting"><h3>7.7.9. SWG Voting</h3>

  <p id="_15a8592f-38e5-425a-8217-7e6eb38ed47c">SWGs operate under the same general voting rules as other sub-groups of the TC, namely Votes in an SWG follow the same guidelines as for the Technical Committee except that quorum is 1/2 of active voting members (see <a href="#caveat-on-voting-rights-if-you-do-not-participate-on-a-regular-basis">Clause 7.7.10</a>) unless the SWG votes to have a larger fraction be quorum. See <a href="#subgroups-of-the-tc-electronic-voting">Clause 6.5</a> for electronic votes for sub-groups of the TC. The one notable exception related to SWG votes is that only member representatives who have opted into the SWG may vote.</p>

Caveat on Voting Rights &#x2013; If you do not participate on a regular basis</h3><p id="_7ff249c2-e0d5-44a2-adf4-84bc309db2f9">If you join a SWG and have voting privileges, you have a responsibility to participate in the teleconference and email dialogues. If you do not participate in the teleconferences and email discussions and vote on items and issues, you will lose your voting privileges and have your SWG member status changed from "Voting" to "Group Member". The SWG Chair has the authority and the ability to make these changes based on the following policy.</p>
<p id="_cd16f48d-fb4d-491e-b46e-174fd8c5c7b1">Quorum for votes on any items or issues brought before a SWG is based on the number of voting members for that SWG. Insuring quorum at SWG meetings is a vital aspect of the SWG being able to complete its work in a timely manner. Therefore, any SWG voting member who misses two consecutive SWG meetings (teleconference, face to face, or webinar) in which votes occur or misses two consecutive email votes shall be deemed as inactive and will not count toward quorum after the second missed vote. The SWG Chair shall take roll call at the beginning of each meeting and determine quorum based on active voting members only. An inactive SWG voting member can become active again simply by attending the SWG meetings and participating. If regular attendance by a given voting member is an issue, that voting member may assign a temporary or permanent proxy to another SWG voting member or to the SWG Chair. The voting member may rescind that proxy at any time. If the voting member wishes not to assign their proxy, they can ask to change their status to "Observer" and still actively participate in the SWG.</p></div>

Public Release of SWG Documents</h3><p id="_c20dc658-f8d4-41ea-921f-8c14a7a786ef">At any time, the SWG voting members may agree to release any SWG in-progress technical document into a public forum, to another standards organization, or to the public for comment. Such an action requires a formal SWG motion and SWG vote as per <a href="#swg-voting">Clause 7.7.9</a>.</p>

  <p id="_f0dfa61a-0895-4d38-bea2-f0944d3208a7">At any time, the SWG can vote to release an in-progress candidate standard for public comment. Please remember that there is the official formal 30-day public comment period. However, a SWG is encouraged to release an in-progress document early in the process in order to solicit input from the community. If a SWG votes to release a document for early public comment, it must coordinate with OGC Communications to generate a press release and properly create the Call for Comments (RFC) on the OGC website.</p>

Strong evidence of implementation as required for the Community standard is generally defined to be implementation in multiple products or environments OR widespread use of the standard in a community, even if in only one or a limited number of products or environments. Evidence of implementation for a standard with Compliance Suite is defined as three or more documented implementations that collectively implement all mandatory requirements of the standard.
